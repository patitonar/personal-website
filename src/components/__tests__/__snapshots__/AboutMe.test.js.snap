        I'm a Software Engineer from Argentina, also a frustrated gamer and a football fan. I love researching cutting edge technologies and playing around with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience working as a full stack developer, although frontend development is what I really like. Some of the technologies I worked with are PHP, Java and nodejs in the backend. On the frontend I built some apps using backbone, angular and react. Also, Ionic for mobile development and React-VR just for VR fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm really good at learning new techs and I always try to build great applications writing elegant code, making focus on good UI/UX, performance, maintainability and working with tools that help me be productive. Also I like contributing to open source projects whenever I have the opportunity.
